Repository of Max patches.

You will likely need the installer from Cycling 74's website to run anything here.

Collectives (found in the Collective folder) can be run without a Max license and without restriction. However these cannot be edited. If you just want to run the max patch, then you want this.

Projects (found in the Project folder) can be run without a license, but with restriction. This is a max project/patch which can be edited. If you want to tweak the UI, objects, or other things, you'll want this.
